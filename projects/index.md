The 504-Anecdotals app is designed for special education teachers who
need an easy way to track student time taken on tests and for supporting
the 504 process for test time extensions. The app was built for my
girlfriend, who is a special education teacher. 504-Anecdotals was my
Nashville Software School capstone for the first half of the program
covering the front-end stack (Javascript, HTML, and CSS). The app uses
Firebase as a backend. Built using Angularjs. The charts were built
using the D3 library. This is my Nashville Software School capstone for

Ruby Cal

The Ruby Cal project was my implementation of a subset of the Unix program, cal. Written in pure Ruby, I took a TDD approach to my implementation of the app using high-level integration tests and low-level unit tests. This project was part of Nashville Software School's Unit One capstone. Objectives included:

* Practice with Arrays, Hashes, and Strings
* Develop the logic of a non-trivial algorithm
* Programming to meet a (changing) specification
