  <h2>NSS Cohort 7 Demo Day Roundup</h2>

  <p>Demo Day marks graduation from NSS, and it&#39;s when students demo their capstone software applications to potential employers at the all-day event. As a student in the software school myself, it was my second time attending a Demo Day at NSS and it was a blast. (Read my roundup of my first Demo Day, which featured Cohort 6, <a href="http://bryanfinlayson.com/blog/nashville-software-school/demo-day-january-2015/" title="Cohort 6 Demo Day">here</a>).  Cohort 7&#39;s capstone apps spanned a diverse array of usage categories, including social media, business, productivity, civic, education, and gaming. In my estimation, the single most popular category for the apps was social media, while apps with a business and/or productivity focus were also prominent. The pie chart below summarizes my assessment of the distribution by category of Cohort 7&#39;s capstone apps. Most apps were built using some combination of C#, AngularJS, ASP .NET MVC, and SQL.</p>

<h2>Social Media</h2>

<p>Students Leon Peck, Jaclyn Pasquale, <a href="http://charisselambert.com/" title="http://charisselambert.com/">Charisse Lambert</a>, Spencer Sharpe, Blaise Gratton, and Adam Sheaffer all built apps with a social media bent. <a href="http://leonpeck.com/" title="Leonpeck.com">Leon Peck</a> used AngularJS, jQuery, C#, Entity Framework to build an app called <a href="http://leonpeck.com/#portfolioModal1" title="Leon Peck&#39;s Which___?">Which___?</a>, which users to anonymously upload two items and have the community vote on which they like more. During a demo of the app, I was impressed by the seamless layout and simple user interface. I was similarly impressed by <a href="http://jaclynpasquale.com/" title="Jaclynpasquale.com">Jaclyn Pasquale</a>&#39;s sleek-looking dating app, called <a href="http://jaclynpasquale.com/#portfolioModal5" title="Haterdate">Haterdate</a>, which uses ASP.NET MVC and AngularJS to match people based on their mutual hate of various things. </p>

<p>Other creative social media apps include those by Spencer Sharpe, Blaise Gratton, and Adam Sheaffer. <a href="http://spencersharpe.com/">Sharpe</a>&#39;s app <a href="https://buzzhub.firebaseapp.com/#/" title="Buzzhub">Buzzhub</a> is a platform where users can find, track, and rate their favorite coffee shops and drinks. <a href="https://adamsheaffer.github.io/" title="adamsheaffer.github.io">Sheaffer</a>&#39;s app <a href="https://github.com/AdamSheaffer/Groundout" title="Groundout">Groundout</a> (which was cleverly integrated with a discount ticket search API by <a href="https://seatgeek.com/" title="seatgeek.com">SeatGeek</a>) targeted the baseball fan market by giving fans a way to log their experience in each ballpark they visit, view comments by other fans, and earn badges as they go. Finally, <a href="http://blaisegratton.me/" title="http://blaisegratton.me/">Gratton</a> demoed two apps, <a href="https://roommate-finder.firebaseapp.com/#/" title="Room Me!">Room Me!</a>, geared toward helping people find roommates, and <a href="http://flashband.azurewebsites.net/" title="http://flashband.azurewebsites.net/">Flashband</a>, which helps musicians find other musicians they might like to play with. I particularly liked the functionality in Room Me! that allowed users to filter potential matches via a weighted algorithm.</p>

<h2>Business</h2>

<p>No Demo Day would be complete without apps in the business category, and business apps were not in short supply. Apps by Gerald Wakefield, <a href="http://stephaniaiyob.com/" title="http://stephaniaiyob.com/">Stephania Iyob</a>, <a href="http://gregkorte.com/" title="http://gregkorte.com/">Greg Korte</a>, and Evan Roan covered a variety of uses in healthcare, psychology, and general business. <a href="http://geraldwakefield.io/" title="http://geraldwakefield.io/">Gerald Wakefield</a>&#39;s app, <a href="http://doctorinthelobby.geraldwakefield.io/#/" title="http://doctorinthelobby.geraldwakefield.io/#/">Doctor In The Lobby</a>, was impressive for its use of data from the Federal Food and Drug Administration&#39;s API to contrast spending by pharmaceutical companies and the adverse effects associated with the drugs that they produce. The app doesn&#39;t prove that higher spending on lobbyists is linked to higher instances of negative side effects, but the data does make a convincing argument. </p>

<p>Also appealing for its use of data was <a href="http://evanroane.com/" title="http://evanroane.com/">Evan Roane</a>&#39;s app, <a href="http://bat.evanroane.com/#/" title="http://bat.evanroane.com/#/">B.A.T.</a>, which stands for behavior analysis tracker. B.A.T is a tool for behavioral psychologists to record data from observing patient behaviors and produce meaningful feedback for implementing interventions. The app can also have applications in education, where behavioral psychologists are sometimes hired to analyze and track child behavior. He is looking for people to contribute to his open-source project, so check the <a href="https://github.com/evanroane/BehaviorAnalysisTracker" title="BAT source code">source code</a> out on Github if you are interested.</p>

<h2>Productivity</h2>

<p>Demo Day also had its fare share of productivity applications, too. Students Colby DeHart, Sonda Sengupta, and Kris Mannino all built applications that were geared, some way or another, toward helping users better organize their lives. <a href="http://sondasengupta.com/" title="http://sondasengupta.com/">Sengupta</a>&#39;s app <a href="http://sondasengupta.com/portfolio/2014/12/25/HomefortheHolidays.html" title="Homes for the Holidays">Homes for the Holidays</a> stood out for its beautiful design and great user interface, while I could see myself using <a href="http://krismannino.com/" title="http://krismannino.com/">Mannino</a>&#39;s app <a href="https://github.com/KrisMannino/reeList" title="ReeList">ReeList</a> for managing and tracking the movies I watch. However, my favorite among the three was <a href="http://colbydehart.com/" title="http://colbydehart.com/">DeHart</a>&#39;s app <a href="http://colbydehart.com/when/#/" title="http://colbydehart.com/when/#/">When</a>, a group activity planner that DeHart&#39;s friends are already actively using to schedule events. Most impressive about the app was its custom algorithm that allows the user to drag a mouse over days of the week in a calendar to select which days they are available to meet. You can find the source code for When on Github <a href="https://github.com/colbydehart/when" title="https://github.com/colbydehart/when">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Civic</h2>

<p>On the civic activism side of things, <a href="http://beckcd.com/" title="http://beckcd.com/">Rebecca Cronin-Dixon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/luketucker28" title="https://github.com/luketucker28">Luke Tucker</a> built civic-minded apps to help Tennessee residents learn more about the resources available to them in their communities. <a href="https://bcd-rescue-me.firebaseapp.com/#/" title="Rescue Me">Rescue Me</a> by Cronin-Dixon is a web application for dog rescue groups to find shelter dogs and manage their existing dogs. Tucker&#39;s app, <a href="https://github.com/luketucker28/TN-Congressional-District-Finder" title="TN Congressional District Finder">Tennessee Congressional District Finder</a>, has a title that is self explanatory: it enables users to identify their congressional representatives by address, providing the representatives political profile, biography, and contact information.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>Targeting the education industry, <a href="http://alexstory.io/" title="http://alexstory.io/">Alex Story</a> built a neat language learning app, called <a href="https://github.com/AlexStory/HiriKata" title="https://github.com/AlexStory/HiriKata">Hirikata</a>. Hirikata is an interactive flashcard application for learning Japanese. Built front to back using an ASP.Net MVC Restful database with an AngularJS front end, it is not to be missed. Check out the source code out <a href="https://github.com/AlexStory/HiriKata" title="https://github.com/AlexStory/HiriKata">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Gaming</h2>

<p>For those who like Sudoku, <a href="http://brandontate.me/" title="http://brandontate.me/">Brandon Tate</a> built a cool version of the game. Try it out <a href="https://nss-sudoku.firebaseapp.com/" title="https://nss-sudoku.firebaseapp.com/">here</a>. You can view the <a href="https://github.com/brandontate/nss-capstone-sudoku" title="Source Code for Sudoku">source code</a> on Github, too.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As a Cohort 8 student who just finished <a href="http://bryanfinlayson.com/code/504-anecdotals/#/login" title="504 Anecdotals">my capstone for the first half of the program</a> at NSS, it was super useful to see what all the other students from Cohort 7 did for their capstone projects. Not only that, it was a valuable experience to see the students present the projects in a professional format and hear them field questions from potential employers. I&#39;m looking forward to my cohort&#39;s Demo Day on June 26!</p>
